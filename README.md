# IML-Final-Project-Bike-Rentals

We experimented with a dataset related to bike rentals in a large European city. Specifically, I used regression, classification and clustering algorithms and evaluated the performance of different models, including linear regression, decision trees, logistic regression, perceptron, support vector regression, random forest, hierarchical clustering, and multi-layer perceptron.

See the assignment report for details.
